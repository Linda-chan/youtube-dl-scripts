    --xattr-set-filesize             Set file xattribute ytdl.filesize with
                                     expected file size (experimental)
    --include-ads                    Download advertisements as well
                                     (experimental)
    --ffmpeg-location PATH           Location of the ffmpeg/avconv binary;
                                     either the path to the binary or its
                                     containing directory.
    --cache-dir DIR                  Location in the filesystem where youtube-dl
                                     can store some downloaded information
                                     permanently. By default $XDG_CACHE_HOME
                                     /youtube-dl or ~/.cache/youtube-dl . At the
                                     moment, only YouTube player files (for
                                     videos with obfuscated signatures) are
                                     cached, but that may change.
    --no-cache-dir                   Disable filesystem caching
    --rm-cache-dir                   Delete all filesystem cache files
